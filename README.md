## Overview
### Regression analysis is a powerful statistical process to find the relations within a dataset, with the key focus  on relationships between the independent variables (predictors) and a dependent variable (outcome). It is also used to build models for inference or prediction. Among several methods of regression analysis, linear regression sets the basis and is quite widely used for several real-world applications.

### Here, I am building a Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regression Model for inference.
### The dataset I am using here comes from the book Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz and is available in kaggle 

### The dataset includes information about the insurance policy holder, their dependents, and their medical expenses throughout a year.
### age: age of primary policyholder

### sex: Sex of the policy policyholder

### bmi: Body Mass Index of policyholder, defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height (kg/m2), ideally 18.5 to 24.9

### children: Number of children/dependents covered in the policy

### smoker: Whether the policyholder is a smoker or a non-smoker

### region: Residential areas of the policy holder (in the US) - North East, South East, South West, North West.

### charges: Yearly medical expenses billed by the medical insurance provider
